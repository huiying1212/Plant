      "domain_explanation": "Source Domain: Kindling wood represents potential—it has the capacity to start a fire, but by itself, it remains inactive. This symbolizes ability or talent, which contains the potential for success or greatness but needs something to ignite it. Target Domain: The target domain is the relationship between ability. The metaphor suggests that talent or skill alone (like kindling) is not enough to achieve success or accomplish anything meaningful without the ambition (the spark) to set that talent into motion. In summary, the metaphor emphasizes that ability (natural talent or potential) is ineffective on its own. Just as kindling wood remains inactive without a spark to ignite it, ability remains unrealized and unproductive without the ambition to push it forward.",

      "source_domain_category": "Plant Plant",
      "source_domain_word": "Tree no-fruit",
      "domain_explanation": "Source Domain: The tree symbolizes natural talent or ability—something that has the inherent capacity to grow and produce something valuable (fruit). However, without the right conditions, care, and cultivation, this potential remains unfulfilled. A tree that bears no fruit represents unrealized potential. It may grow and look healthy, but it does not produce anything useful or valuable. This symbolizes ability that goes untapped because it lacks the proper nurturing (in this case, education) to bring it to full fruition. Target Domain: The target domain is the relationship between natural ability and education. The metaphor suggests that while a person may be born with talent or intelligence, these qualities need to be developed and refined through education in order to become truly productive. In summary, the metaphor suggests that native ability without education is like a tree that bears no fruit—it has potential, but without the proper nurturing (education), it remains unproductive. Just as a tree needs care to produce fruit, natural talent needs education to be fully developed and turn into something useful and valuable. The comparison emphasizes the importance of education in transforming raw ability into actual achievement and success.",

      "domain_explanation": "Source Domain: Colorful flowers are visually appealing, representing beauty, charm, and pleasing appearances. In this context, they symbolize words and thoughts that may sound virtuous or impressive but remain superficial if not backed by action. A flower that has no fragrance is missing an essential part of its appeal, despite its outer beauty. This symbolizes the emptiness of words and ideas when they are not accompanied by meaningful actions. Just as a flower without fragrance lacks depth, words without action lack substance and true value. Target Domain: The target domain is the distinction between expressing compassion through words and thoughts versus demonstrating compassion through actions. The metaphor emphasizes that while thoughts and words about compassion may be beautiful and well-intentioned, they are incomplete without being put into practice. In summary, the metaphor suggests that words and thoughts about compassionate action that are not put into practice are like colorful flowers without fragrance—they may look or sound virtuous, but they lack substance and true value without action. Just as a flower’s beauty is incomplete without its fragrance, compassion is incomplete without being translated into meaningful deeds. The comparison emphasizes that true compassion requires action to be fully realized and impactful.",

      "domain_explanation": "Source Domain: Desert flowers lie dormant during dry periods, waiting for the right conditions—such as rain—to bloom. This represents habits or addictions that are not currently active but are still present, waiting for the right triggers to bring them back to life. The flowers symbolize the potential for something to reawaken, even if it appears to be inactive or forgotten. When desert flowers bloom, they do so quickly and fully, transforming the landscape with color and growth. This symbolizes how, under certain conditions, old habits or addictions can re-emerge rapidly and intensely, taking over a person’s life in a similar way to the sudden bloom of flowers. Target Domain: The target domain is old habits and addictions that, while dormant or under control, are still present within the person. The metaphor suggests that these habits, though seemingly in the past, are like seeds waiting for the right conditions to resurface and take over once again. In summary, the metaphor suggests that old habits and addictions, though currently dormant, are like desert flowers—lying beneath the surface, waiting for the right conditions to burst into full bloom. These habits, though seemingly under control, can quickly and powerfully reawaken if triggered. The comparison emphasizes the latent nature of addictions and the potential for them to resurface dramatically if not carefully managed.",

      "domain_explanation": "Source Domain: A cactus symbolizes resilience and the ability to endure harsh environments, such as the desert. It is also known for its prickly exterior, which serves as a form of protection. This represents the challenging and sometimes defensive nature of adolescence, where teenagers may appear tough or difficult, but they are also learning to survive and grow in a sometimes harsh and confusing world. Target Domain: The target domain is adolescence, a time of emotional turbulence, self-discovery, and personal growth. The metaphor suggests that adolescence, like a cactus, is a phase where individuals are often guarded, self-protective, and sometimes difficult to understand, but also resilient and capable of enduring the challenges of growing up. In summary, the metaphor suggests that adolescence is like a cactus—tough, prickly, and often difficult to navigate, but also marked by resilience and the ability to thrive despite challenges. Just as a cactus survives in harsh conditions with its protective thorns, adolescents often guard themselves emotionally while learning to adapt and grow through the turbulent experiences of youth. The comparison highlights both the difficulties and strengths of this critical developmental phase.",

This symbolizes the heart’s natural openness to gentle, loving, and compassionate experiences, which help it grow and flourish. Target Domain: The target domain is the human heart and how it responds to different emotional experiences. The metaphor suggests that, like flowers, hearts are open and receptive to gentle, loving care, but they tend to shut down in the face of emotional overwhelm or harm. In summary, the metaphor suggests that the human heart, like a flower, is most open and receptive when it is treated with kindness, gentleness, and compassion (symbolized by the dew). Just as flowers thrive when nourished by soft dew, hearts flourish when they are cared for with love and tenderness.",

This symbolizes how affection is a deep, intrinsic part of this person’s character, something that supports and sustains their entire being at a fundamental level. Target Domain: The target domain is how affection functions within this person’s spirit. The metaphor suggests that affection is not just a surface-level feeling or something expressed outwardly, but rather it is a core element of who they are, providing them with emotional stability and growth. In summary, the metaphor indicates that affection is something much deeper and more essential to the person.

Target Domain: The target domain is ambitious men and the blasts of fortune they face. The metaphor suggests that just as tall trees are more affected by strong winds, ambitious men—those who seek great success—are more likely to be impacted by the unpredictable ups and downs of life. Their ambition exposes them to greater risks, challenges, and external pressures.

The metaphor suggests that this person’s value is not in himself, but in the accomplishments of his ancestors, which are no longer visible or relevant in his present life. In summary, the metaphor suggests that a man who has nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestors is like a potato, where the only good part lies underground—meaning that his value comes from the past (his ancestors) and not from anything he has accomplished himself.

Just as soil can only absorb so much water before it becomes oversaturated, the mind can only take in a limited number of aphorisms before it needs time to process and absorb them. A fully saturated lawn represents the point at which the soil can no longer absorb any more water. This symbolizes how the mind, after reading a few aphorisms, reaches a point where it cannot take in any more meaning or insight without time to reflect and internalize what has already been absorbed. Target Domain: The target domain is the act of reading aphorisms. The metaphor suggests that aphorisms are best read and absorbed slowly, and reading too many at once leads to information overload, where the mind cannot fully absorb or reflect on the meaning. This diminishes their impact and value. In summary, the metaphor suggests that reading too many aphorisms at once is like overwatering a lawn that is already saturated—the excess reading, like excess water, simply runs off without being absorbed. Aphorisms are dense and require time for reflection, and overloading the mind with too many at once causes the meaning to be lost or diminished.

This represents how creation in the natural world often happens without self-awareness or the ability to explain the process. Horticulture is the science or art of cultivating plants, and the plant itself has no knowledge of this process. This represents the idea that an artist, like the plant, cannot fully explain the deeper forces that guide their creative process, even though it is influenced by many internal or external factors. Target Domain: The target domain is the relationship between the artist and their art.

The artist creates without fully understanding or being able to articulate the deeper forces that drive their creativity. In summary, the metaphor suggests that an artist cannot easily explain their art, much like a plant cannot discuss horticulture.

However, it also implies that these ideas may be fragile, not fully developed, or prone to fading just as quickly as they appear. Target Domain: The target domain is California’s tendency to be a hotbed of innovation and trends, where new ideas are rapidly embraced but also easily discarded.

      "domain_explanation": "Source Domain: The source domain comes from the elements of a garden: gardens, roots, blossoms, and fruits. Each of these parts plays a vital role in the growth and flourishing of a plant or tree. Gardens are places of growth and beauty, while roots provide the foundation, blossoms represent the flowering stage, and fruits are the tangible results of nurturing care. Target Domain: The target domain is the different elements of kindness—kind hearts, thoughts, words, and deeds. Each of these elements is connected to a part of the garden metaphor, showing how kindness develops, from the foundation to its visible, fruitful outcomes. Kind hearts are like gardens, the overall space where kindness grows and is cultivated. The heart is where kindness originates, where it is nurtured and allowed to flourish, just as a garden is a space for plants to grow. Kind thoughts are compared to the roots of the garden. Roots are the foundation of any plant, absorbing nutrients and providing stability. Similarly, kind thoughts form the foundation for kind actions and words, anchoring kindness in a strong mental and emotional base. Kind words are likened to blossoms, the beautiful and visible expressions of a plant's growth. Blossoms are the first signs of a plant's maturity, just as kind words are the first outward expressions of internal kindness. They are what others see and experience, offering beauty and positivity. Kind deeds are compared to fruits, the ultimate product of a well-cared-for garden. Fruits are the tangible, nourishing results of growth, just as kind deeds are the concrete outcomes of a kind heart, thoughts, and words. Kind deeds, like fruits, provide sustenance and benefit to others, representing the fullest expression of kindness. In summary, the metaphor suggests that kindness is like a garden. Kind hearts are the spaces where kindness grows, kind thoughts are the roots that provide stability and nourishment, kind words are the blossoms that beautifully express kindness outwardly, and kind deeds are the fruits—the final, nourishing product that benefits others.

This process symbolizes transformation, growth, and ultimate unity. Each stage of the water's journey represents a phase of change and development, growing from something small and defined (a spring) into something vast and all-encompassing (the ocean). Target Domain: The target domain is love, which is compared to the evolving journey of water. Love begins as something small and intimate, like a fresh spring, but as it deepens and grows, it transforms into something larger and more powerful, eventually merging with the infinite and boundless. This metaphor emphasizes how love evolves from a simple, pure emotion into something profound, potentially even transcendent. In summary, the metaphor suggests that love begins like a fresh spring, pure and simple, but as it grows, it becomes more intense and complex, like a stream and then a river. Eventually, it merges with a boundless ocean, representing the ultimate, limitless nature of love. Some may find this vastness overwhelming or monotonous, but those with profound emotional and intellectual depth—\"great souls\"—find endless meaning and contemplation in love’s infinite nature.

In summary, the metaphor suggests that memory is like an onion with many layers, each one representing a barrier or complexity in recollection. When questioned, memory is slowly revealed, but it seldom presents itself clearly or directly.

The problem, though, is that the great masses of people do not admire it and “nearly all, at heart, think they can do very well without it.” He argued: “Originality is the one thing which original minds cannot feel the use of. They cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? If they could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality. The first service which originality has to render them is that of opening their eyes.”",

The metaphor suggests that the purpose of life is to grow into one’s fullest, most authentic expression, just as these natural elements do. The self’s ultimate goal is to flourish, whether that manifests as beauty, strength, wisdom, or personal fulfillment. In summary, the metaphor suggests that the living self has one purpose: to reach its full potential and flourish in its own unique way, just as a tree blossoms, a bird comes into its spring beauty, and a tiger grows into its luster. These natural elements symbolize different aspects of growth, renewal, and strength, reflecting the idea that the self’s purpose is to fully realize its potential, whether through beauty, power, or personal fulfillment.

The metaphor suggests that these three conditions are interrelated, growing from the same root cause: self-awareness and moral knowledge. In summary, the metaphor draws from the biblical image of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, whose fruit symbolizes the gaining of moral and ethical awareness. The implication is that once humans become aware of right and wrong—through knowledge—they also become susceptible to feelings of guilt (for doing wrong), sin (for moral failings), and neurosis (for the internal conflict and anxiety that comes from navigating these complex moral landscapes).",

These fruits are enjoyed at their peak but quickly spoil or lose their quality if not consumed in time. This symbolizes the transience of beauty, which, like ripe fruit, is temporary and prone to deterioration. The phrase \"easy to corrupt\" suggests that beauty, like summer fruits, is vulnerable to decay or damage. Just as fruit can spoil quickly if not properly cared for, beauty can be easily corrupted or lost due to time, external influences, or changing circumstances. This reflects the fragility of beauty. Target Domain: The target domain is beauty, which is compared to summer fruits in terms of its temporary nature and vulnerability to corruption. The metaphor implies that beauty, while initially vibrant and appealing, is not permanent and is subject to the effects of time, just as ripe fruit quickly decays if not consumed. In summary, the metaphor suggests that beauty is like summer fruits—it is ephemeral, fragile, and easily corrupted.

Target Domain: The target domain is the experience of torture, which, like the effects of hallucinogens, induces a state of mental confusion, heightened perception, and mental overwhelm. Under torture, the mind is filled with a chaotic flood of memories and thoughts, but instead of enlightenment or clarity, it leads to pain, horror, and emotional descent. In summary, the metaphor suggests that under torture, the mind is affected in a way similar to being under the influence of hallucinogenic substances. The experience becomes overwhelming and disorienting, as if the tortured person is losing control of their mental faculties, leading to an altered, nightmarish state where thoughts and memories resurface uncontrollably.",

It represents something that is just starting to develop but has the capacity to grow into something more complex, like a twig. This symbolizes a word, which has the potential to grow into something more meaningful or significant as it is used and understood. A twig is a more developed part of a plant, representing growth, structure, and the ability to form new connections (as branches grow from it). This symbolizes the evolution of a word, suggesting that a word, when used in context or combined with other words, can grow into a larger concept, idea, or expression. Target Domain: The target domain is language and words, which, like a bud, have the potential to grow in meaning and significance. The metaphor implies that a word starts as a small, simple expression but can develop into something more complex, much like a bud grows into a twig. A twig is a more mature stage of growth that connects to other parts of a plant, symbolizing how a word can lead to deeper meanings, form connections with other ideas, or grow into a more complete thought. The word’s \"attempt\" to become a twig reflects the dynamic nature of language, as words evolve through use and context to express more complex ideas. In summary, the metaphor suggests that a word is like a bud—a small, emerging entity with the potential to grow into something more developed and connected, like a twig. Just as a bud strives to grow into a twig and become part of a larger plant, a word has the potential to grow in meaning and connect to other ideas, leading to deeper understanding.

In summary, the metaphor suggests that while the body is necessary as the vessel (cask), the soul is the true essence and should be valued above all else. Just as a cask holds valuable liquor, the body holds the soul, which is the source of true worth and meaning.

In summary, the metaphor suggests that the body’s death is like grain planted in the ground, which lies dormant for a season before springing to new life in a glorified form. This natural cycle of dormancy followed by renewal in spring underscores the belief that death is a temporary phase leading to a transformed and abundant existence.

Target Domain: The new deed is like a growing fruit, initially integrated with unconscious life and not yet processed or fully understood. It’s simply part of the flow of lived experience, not yet distinct in our conscious mind. In summary, the metaphor suggests that new deeds, like ripening fruit, are initially part of unconscious life and only later become distinct thoughts through contemplation.

It must rely on chance growth, external conditions, or cloning techniques, making it dependent on circumstances outside of its control. Target Domain: Wisdom, like a seedless plant, cannot be planted or generated deliberately. It must emerge naturally from experience, reflection, or insight, depending on specific conditions that cannot be controlled or manufactured. In summary, the metaphor suggests that wisdom, like a seedless plant, cannot be intentionally produced; it arises spontaneously and requires specific, often uncontrollable conditions to appear. Once wisdom emerges, however, it can be nurtured and developed, reflecting the idea that wisdom is an organic, unpredictable quality that flourishes under the right circumstances but cannot be artificially created. This comparison highlights the delicate, rare nature of wisdom as something that depends on experience and insight rather than sheer will.",

It holds tremendous potential, even though it might seem inert on the outside. When a seed germinates, it can exert great force to push through the soil, representing the powerful, even explosive release of potential that can be hidden within small or quiet beginnings. Target Domain: Although she appears ordinary, the girl has qualities, talents, or inner strengths that are not obvious but are capable of significant impact. These qualities mirror the powerful potential within a seed that lies dormant until the right conditions are met. The inner forces may manifest unexpectedly and powerfully, suggesting that her potential could reveal itself in ways that surprise or disrupt others, much like the forceful emergence of a plant breaking through soil. In summary, the metaphor suggests that the girl, like a seed, holds dormant forces within her that may appear suddenly and dramatically, surprising those who see only her outward ordinariness.

However, at St. James's, a more formal and political environment, Thurlow becomes like the willow, demonstrating flexibility and the ability to adapt to a different social or political atmosphere, perhaps yielding to the expectations or pressures of the elite. In summary, the metaphor compares Thurlow to an oak at Westminster and a willow at St. James’s, highlighting his ability to be both strong and resolute in one environment while being flexible and adaptable in another. This suggests that Thurlow is a person who knows when to stand firm and when to yield, adjusting his approach to suit the demands of the situation.
